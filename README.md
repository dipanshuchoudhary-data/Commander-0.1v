🎙️ Commander 0.1v

A local voice command system (early prototype)

Overview

Commander 0.1v is the first experimental prototype of a local voice command system.
This version is not polished, not optimized, and is intended only as a proof of concept.

The goal of this release is to validate:

Microphone input handling

Local speech-to-text (offline)

Basic command execution

Future versions will focus on reliability, usability, and accuracy.

Prototype Status (Important)

⚠️ This is a prototype and the first version of the project.
⚠️ Accuracy and user experience are limited.
⚠️ Unexpected behavior is expected.

This version exists to test the core idea, not to provide a production-ready assistant.

What It Can Do (Basic)

🎤 Record short voice commands (press-to-record)

🧠 Convert speech to text using local Whisper

⚙️ Execute simple actions:

Open applications

Search local files

Play music

All processing is local (no cloud APIs).
